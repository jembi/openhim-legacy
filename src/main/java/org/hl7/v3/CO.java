 * 
 *             Coded data, where the domain from which the codeset comes
 *             is ordered. The Coded Ordinal data type adds semantics
 *             related to ordering so that models that make use of such
 *             domains may introduce model elements that involve statements
 *             about the order of the terms in a domain.
